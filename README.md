## Summary

This is a Algorithm-Viewer, which allows the user to select an algorithm and visualy see it be executed.

## MVP List

- Able to Select different algorithms to be visially executed
- Visually executed algorithms look stunning and make use of of Canvas
- Able to slow down, speed up or pause visual display
- There is a user selected input that matches the asthetic, for how many data points to use in algorithm

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

- Canvas
- Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS
- ### Technical Challenges
  - Learning and implementing Canvas
  - Using Canvas in a dynamic way, rendering random or generated artificats then moving them around to visualized sorting or searching
  - Pausing/ Speeding and or slowing the rendering must all be connected somehow
  - Dealing with Asynchronicity in JS when also trying to render multiple objects and do certain things, possible code strucutre issue
  - Creating a unqiue and compelling visual design for the showcasing the algorithm.

## TimeLine

- ### DAY 1
  - Complete hosting and having a complete site rendering with algorithm logic in place (quicksort), start to learn the Canvas library and finilize visual style to implement
- ### DAY 2
  - Use the in place logic of the algorithm, and start to implemnt and replace it with Canvas graphics
- ### DAY 3
  - Continue the implementation.
- ### DAY 4
  - Start a New algorithm (Merge Sort), writing the main implementation ut first along with the button to switch to the new algorithm. Starting the Canvas visual styling
- ### DAY 5
  - Finishing up the visual styling for the previous Algorithm, if Done moving on to either Radix Sort or Djikstra Algorithm, the latter would require a different visual scheme.
